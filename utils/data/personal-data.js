  description: "I hold a cum laude Masterâ€™s in AI from the University of Pisa, where my thesis introduced a novel autoregressive GNN for multivariate time series generation. My core focus is developing and applying Graph Neural Networks for complex time series analysis. At ION Trading, I engineer AI systems that model client needs and market data to provide automated guidance on financial investments. Looking forward, I aim to pivot my core expertise in spatiotemporal modeling towards critical societal problems, specifically within the domain of energy informatics.",
